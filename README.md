# Algorithms


The algorithms gem is a comprehensive Ruby library offering a range of essential data structures and algorithms. It includes efficient implementations of algorithms for sorting, searching, and graph traversal, as well as various data structures such as heaps, stacks, queues, and trees. This gem is ideal for developers who need ready-to-use, reliable tools for solving computational problems and optimizing their Ruby applications.

## Installation

Please Clone this file to your local and we have not added this gem rubygems.org portal.

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:


```bash
gem install algorithms-(*version).gem
```

## Usage

TODO: 

Binary Search (Please send the array in sorted order)
```
arr = Algorithms::Search::BinarySearch.new(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)
arr.search_value(3)
=> true
arr.search_value(10)
=> false
```
Heap

```
MinHeap

heap = Algorithms::Heap::MinHeap.new

## Insert the element
heap.push(10)
heap.push(20)
heap.push(5)
heap.push(8)
heap.push(11)

# Returns the smallest element
heap.top => 5

# removes the top element
heap.pop 

# get the size of heap
heap.size

```

```
MaxHeap

heap = Algorithms::Heap::MaxHeap.new

## Insert the element
heap.push(10)
heap.push(20)
heap.push(5)
heap.push(8)
heap.push(11)

# Returns the smallest element
heap.top => 20

# removes the top element
heap.pop 

# get the size of heap
heap.size

```
